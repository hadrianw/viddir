# Viddir

A crude video web-gallery.

Currently unsafe - WIP. Mostly for home use, not to be exposed to the Internet.

Shows thumbnails and has simple tagging.

Made with CGI, shell and a bit of C. For thumbnails generation ffmpeg is used.

Index page as of yet:

http://hostname/cgi-bin/index.sh

- store/ - all files reside here
- tags/ - root of tags, inside a directory per tag, inside every directory
  are symbolic links to the files stored in the store directory
- thumbs/ - all generated thumbnails

Default sorting by mtime.

Index page shows everything from store.
